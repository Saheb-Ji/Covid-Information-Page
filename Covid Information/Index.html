        <h2>Dos and Don’ts of etiquette during COVID-19 pandemic</h2>
        <h3>Information about acceptable etiquette during COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
        <p>
        <h4>Etiquette of gatherings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do serve food in a place with proper distancing measures. Open lawns and bigger spaces are always safer for gatherings.</li>
                <li>Do keep some extra masks on hand while hosting/attending a gathering. If you’re the host, ensure that there are proper handwashing stations and an adequate supply of sanitizers placed at the entrance/exit or other prominent places.</li>
                <li>Do not plan gatherings in small, constricted, or poorly ventilated spaces.</li>
                <li>Try keeping the number of guests to a minimum and in-sync with the government’s guidelines on COVID-19. Digital/virtual celebrations are ideal and preferable.</li>
                <li>Do not attend gatherings if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Self-isolate for 14 days before meeting friends and family and inform people you might have come in contact with.</li>
                <li>Do not pressurise friends or relatives into participating in gatherings or celebrations. If they are not comfortable in attending the gathering, respect their decision.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Etiquette of greetings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do let go of your habit of greeting people the way you used to before the pandemic. A handshake, a hug, a kiss, they all come with a considerable amount of risk and unless you live together and are in constant touch, this might be unsafe.</li>
                <li>Do show your respect and appreciation to people by greeting them with a wave, traditional Namaste or Adaab, or an elbow bump. The lesser the physical contact, the safer it is.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h4>Etiquette around vaccination:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do get yourself fully vaccinated and be honest about your vaccination status.</li>
                <li>Do not get involved in conversations about the efficacy and safety of various COVID-19 vaccines if you do not have verified information. Stay away from conversations that encourage misinformation and myths. It is also advisable to politely communicate to people the dangers of misinformation.</li>
                <li>Do not boast about a particular vaccine that you have taken by claiming that it is of better quality than the rest. Understand that all vaccines provide safety against severe infections of COVID-19.</li>
              
            </ul>
            <h4>Etiquette of travelling:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do wear your mask properly throughout the travel. Also, you can politely tell a co-passenger to wear a mask if they are not wearing one already.</li>
                <li>Do not remove your mask in public places to click photographs.</li>
                <li>Do not indulge in attempting to get unauthorised certificates of "fully vaccinated" in order to travel to places where it is mandatory.</li>
            </ul>
